# Check Your Understanding
1. I would fit them into a Github Action that runs whenever code is pushed. This way, we can check that our code does not break anything and is working as expected before merging our code to our production branch. 

2. No, an end to end test is not needed for functions. We can have regular unit tests that call the function and check its outputs.

3. Snapshot cannot scroll and will analyze whatever is on the screen. Navigation will be able to go through the whole loading cycle from the beginning. 

4. We could properly size the images. We could also reduce some unused Javascript. Lastly, we could preconnect to required origins.
